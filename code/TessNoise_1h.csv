### This data is taken from Fig 8 from Ricker et al.
### I used WebPlotDigitizer to pull the data out of the figure
### This is the CDPP in ppm in one hour.
### I've added a lower bounding value because I think it's justified
### I've also extrapolated beyond 18th mag, this looks reasonable, I used a UnivariateSpline
